# Bot.py Overview

`Bot.py` is the main file for the GoldyChat bot. This Python script integrates various components of the bot, listens for messages on Discord, and responds to them using the OpenAI GPT-3 model. Here is a brief explanation of the key parts of `Bot.py`:

## Importing Dependencies

The script starts by importing various modules and functions required for its operation. These include modules for actions, feedback, memory, OpenAI API calls, text formatting, and state management.

## Async Functions

Two asynchronous functions are defined in this script: `start_NLCM_timer()` and `on_ready()`. 

### start_NLCM_timer()

This function implements a timer that keeps track of the time passed since the last message received. If 60 seconds pass with no new messages, the function triggers the NLCM function (presumably a function related to memory management or interaction context).

### on_ready()

This function is an event handler that is called when the bot is ready. It prints a login message and starts the NLCM timer. If the bot has internet access, it also prints a message indicating that it's starting the Chrome browser.

## Event Listener

`@client.event async def on_message(message):` is an event listener for when a message is received from Discord. It ignores messages from the bot itself, prints the received message, and updates the state with the time of the last message, the channel, and the author of the message.

## Additional Functions

Several other functions are defined in the script, such as `print_loginMSG()`, which prints a login message and connectivity status when the bot is ready.

# Note

This is a high-level overview of the `Bot.py` script, based on the information available as of May 2023. The actual functionality may be more complex and context-dependent. Please refer to the code for the most accurate understanding.

# Disclaimer

Please note that as the bot is in development mode, it is not ready for production. Be careful if you give it internet access. Always ensure the security and privacy of your interactions when using or developing chatbots.
